# Website recreation

For my project I have recreated the website for [IN-N-OUT Burger](https://www.in-n-out.com 'Link title').
  
The hero section is an image caraousel.
I included a food menu in form of a table and accordian. I made a section on the restuarant's history.
Lastly I included a form section for name, email, and message sections with a functional submit button.



## Features
For this project I included the following bootstrap components:

- Caraousel for the Hero section
- Table for the menu
- Accordian for the second part of the menu
- Cards for the history
The form section was also constructed using bootstrap.

## Javascript
I have composed five blocks of code for the Javascript portion.

- Email Validation, I would incorporate this in the future to validate an email input to check if the input is properly input.

- onclick event, this function has been intergrated. When you click on the button you get an alert.

- Search Locations, in the actual website they have a form to locate a restuarants locations. I would use this function to do the same.

- Shopping Cart, as an ecommerce website I would intergrate this function to add items for purchase in the online store.

- Card Validation, for this function I would connect to a database in order to check if a gift card or other form of pay is valid.
